## Heuristic Methods for Optimization – R Code

This repository contains the R implementation used in the final project report
for the course *Heuristic Methods for Optimization*.

### Problem Description
The problem addressed is a driver assignment problem between Konya and Ankara,
subject to minimum rest time constraints.

### Implemented Methods
- Greedy assignment heuristic
- Tabu Search metaheuristic

### Repository Structure
- `code/iteration.R`: Main R script containing all algorithms
- `data/`: Excel input files used in the experiments

### Reproducibility
All computational results reported in the study were obtained using the code
provided in this repository.
